            i am a student in the university pursuing bachelor of bussiness computing and studying from bugema university
            i grew up in a refugee camp in kiryandongo district(uganda) this is because my parents migrated from south sudan early 
            in 1999 due to the endless civil war in the country(sudan) so most of my life i was in uganda and even up do date i still
            live in this country.

            amazing,she was with us when daddy was away always each time we needed help when daddy is far in his hustles
