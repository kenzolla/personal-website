     <h2>BACK GROUND AND NATIONALITY</h2>
     <p>
         kenneth was born on june 23rd 1997 in south sudan a village call magwi in the Eastern part of the country,
         he was brought to uganda when he was 1year old by his parents due to the political instability which displaced his parents from 
         south sudan in 1998,this therefore means they settled as refugees in a camp...he grew up in the camp (kiryandongo refugee settlement camp)
         in mid western uganda where he started his kindergarten and primary education from
         however his parents migrated back in south sudan in 2008 when a peace agreement was reached by the opposition and the goverment 
         which led to the signing of peace agreement. due to the difficult of attaining what to eat they had to move
         back to there country of origin(south sudan)
         he completed his primary education from there and joined secondary school straight away.
         however due to the in opposition rise in 2016, i had to come back to uganda in order to continue with my studies

         and now am in bugema university thats a short story of myself.
